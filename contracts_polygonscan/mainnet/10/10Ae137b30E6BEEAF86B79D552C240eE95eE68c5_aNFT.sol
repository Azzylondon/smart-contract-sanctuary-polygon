* @title    Registry
* @notice   A contract which is essentially a glorified forwarder.
*           It essentially brings together people who want things executed,
*           and people who want to do that execution in return for a fee.
*           Users register the details of what they want executed, which
*           should always revert unless their execution condition is true,
*           and executors execute the request when the condition is true.
*           Only a specific executor is allowed to execute requests at any
*           given time, as determined by the StakeManager, which requires
*           staking AUTO tokens. This is infrastructure, and an integral
*           piece of the future of web3. It also provides the spark of life
*           for a new form of organism - cyber life. We are the gods now.
