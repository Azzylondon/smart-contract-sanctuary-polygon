///
/// There are only 3 "core" opcodes for `RainVM`:
/// - `0`: Skip self and optionally additional opcodes, `0 0` is a noop
/// - `1`: Copy value from either `constants` or `arguments` at index `operand`
///   to the top of the stack. High bit of `operand` is `0` for `constants` and
///   `1` for `arguments`.
/// - `2`: Zipmap takes N values from the stack, interprets each as an array of

///   from `sources` over these. See `zipmap` for more details.
///
/// To do anything useful the contract that inherits `RainVM` needs to provide
/// opcodes to build up an internal DSL. This may sound complex but it only
/// requires mapping opcode integers to functions to call, and reading/writing
/// values to the stack as input/output for these functions. Further, opcode
/// packs are provided in rain that any inheriting contract can use as a normal
/// solidity library. See `MathOps.sol` opcode pack and the
/// `CalculatorTest.sol` test contract for an example of how to dispatch
/// opcodes and handle the results in a wrapping contract.
///
/// RainVM natively has no concept of branching logic such as `if` or loops.
/// An opcode pack could implement these similar to the core zipmap by lazily
/// evaluating a source from `sources` based on some condition, etc. Instead
/// some simpler, eagerly evaluated selection tools such as `min` and `max` in
/// the `MathOps` opcode pack are provided. Future versions of `RainVM` MAY
/// implement lazy `if` and other similar patterns.
///
/// The `eval` function is `view` because rain scripts are expected to compute
/// results only without modifying any state. The contract wrapping the VM is
/// free to mutate as usual. This model encourages exposing only read-only
/// functionality to end-user deployers who provide scripts to a VM factory.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
