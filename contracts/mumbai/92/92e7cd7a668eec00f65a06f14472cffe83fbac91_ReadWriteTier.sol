/// - MUST represent held tiers as a `uint`.
/// - MUST implement `report`.
///   - The report is a `uint256` that SHOULD represent the block each tier has

///   - The encoded tiers start at `1`; Tier `0` is implied if no tier has ever
///     been held.
///   - Tier `0` is NOT encoded in the report, it is simply the fallback value.

/// - SHOULD implement `setTier`.
///   - Contracts SHOULD revert with `SET_TIER` error if they cannot
///     meaningfully set a tier directly.
///     For example a contract that can only derive a membership tier by
///     reading the state of an external contract cannot set tiers.
