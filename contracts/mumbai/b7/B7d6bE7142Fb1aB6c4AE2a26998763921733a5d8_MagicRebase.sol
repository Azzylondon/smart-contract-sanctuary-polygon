 * @title MagicRebase ERC20 token
 * @dev This is part of an implementation of the uFragments Ideal Money protocol.
 *      uFragments is a normal ERC20 token, but its supply can be adjusted by splitting and
 *      combining tokens proportionally across all wallets.
 *
 *      uFragment balances are internally represented with a hidden denomination, 'gons'.
 *      We support splitting the currency in expansion and combining the currency on contraction by
 *      changing the exchange rate between the hidden 'gons' and the public 'fragments'.

    // Anytime there is division, there is a risk of numerical instability from rounding errors. In
    // order to minimize this risk, we adhere to the following guidelines:
    // 1) The conversion rate adopted is the number of gons that equals 1 fragment.
    //    The inverse rate must not be used--TOTAL_GONS is always the numerator and _totalSupply is
    //    always the denominator. (i.e. If you want to convert gons to fragments instead of
    //    multiplying by the inverse rate, you should divide by the normal rate)
    // 2) Gon balances converted into Fragments are always rounded down (truncated).
    //
    // We make the following guarantees:
    // - If address 'A' transfers x Fragments to address 'B'. A's resulting external balance will
    //   be decreased by precisely x Fragments, and B's external balance will be precisely
    //   increased by x Fragments.
    //
    // We do not guarantee that the sum of all balances equals the result of calling totalSupply().
    // This is because, for any conversion function 'f()' that has non-zero rounding error,
    // f(x0) + f(x1) + ... + f(xn) is not always equal to f(x0 + x1 + ... xn).
