/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is

 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using

 * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the
 * time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter.
 *
 * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
 * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}
 * function.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and
