 * @dev These functions deal with verification of Merkle Trees proofs.
 *
 * The proofs can be generated using the JavaScript library
 * https://github.com/miguelmota/merkletreejs[merkletreejs].
 * Note: the hashing algorithm should be keccak256 and pair sorting should be enabled.
 *
 * See `test/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.test.js` for some examples.
 *
 * WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to
 * hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves.
 * This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in
 * the merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.
