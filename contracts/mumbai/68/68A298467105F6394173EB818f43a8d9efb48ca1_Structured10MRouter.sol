/**
 *
 * A custom contract that acts as a CID registry for IPFS directories.
 *
 * This contract is a delegate contract used by the [Structured10MRelease] contract
 * for its `uri` contruction code. The purpose of it is to determine what IPFS CID
 * value to use for a given NFT ID.
 *
 * The reason why this code exists is to allow the Structured10MRelease ERC1155 contract
 * to allow for NFTs to be registered even if the underlying NFT collection expands in size.
 * This is usually not possible with a ERC1155 contract, unless IPFS isn't used (i.e. you
 * use your own domain to host the NFT metadata). Because IPFS directories (i.e. where the CID
 * reflects the contents of a directory) cannot be updated without the CID changing, this router
 * will handle that CID changing behavior throughout the collection being published. Once the
 * NFT collection is complete, then the ownership of this contract and the parent
 * Structured10MRelease contract will be relinquished so that the NFT collection stays immutable.
 *
 * ## How the "routing" works
 * This contract allows for two things:
 *   1. Registration of new routes
 *   2. Resolution of routes via the provided ID
 *
 * When the contract is instantiated for the first time, it will require a `itemsPerRoute` value
 * which specifies how many IPFS metadata files will be stored in each IPFS directory. Then,
 * when a route is registered (via the `registerRoute()` method), the provided `index` value is
 * used to reference which IPFS directory the route lives in (and what the `cid` value is).
 *
 * With routes registered, when the `lookup()` method is called, it can determine what directory
 * (or route) the provided `itemIndex` lives in (this happens by diving the `itemIndex` by
 * the `itemsPerRoute` value). Once determined, the CID value for that `itemIndex` is returned.
 *
 * The parent contract (Structured10MRelease) then uses the CID value and places that into the
 * IPFS URI that it assembles within the `uri()` method.
 *
 * ## What happens if the routes collection expands?
 * When instantiated, the contract below will pre-fill an array of routes (for performance
 * reasons) so that it doesn't have to expand the size of the array everytime a new route is
 * filled. If an when a new route is added that goes beyond the pre-fill size, the registration
 * code will expand the array by inserting additional cells up until the new route index.
 *

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure

 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
