This function does all of the heavy lifting. '86' is slang for cancel the order,
so if you send an 86 to the address field, nothing address will be included. I give you
potentially eight of these fields, so you could craft and send quite elaborate index structures
across the currency. You need to input valid HTML, but that can be created beforehand. You
can also just send text.
