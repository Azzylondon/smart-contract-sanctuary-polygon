Add the smart contract address of the suspicious Token on
the Ethereum network. A linkage will naturally get created that would be 
visible in Etherscan if people click on 'click to view address on 
other chains'. Not only does this give the user an action to do
directly from Etherscan, but 3rd Parth Scan alert websites can
monitor this. The obviously unspendable address which is all twos
is now purposed to be a global index for scam warning. Contribute to 
this project by sending Polygon directly to its address.
